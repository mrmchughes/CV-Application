# CV Application

This is my implementation of The Odin Project's CV Application project.

[Live Demo](https://mrmchughes.github.io/CV-Application/)

I developed this React app as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application) Fullstack curriculum. It was an exciting milestone to reach, as this was the first major React app I have done.
